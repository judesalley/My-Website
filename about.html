<p>"My child was an apathetic learner to say the least. She could've cared less about school, and we were lacking resources at home to help her. Traditional tutoring options were too expensive, but then we found this program. It provides the same invaluable instruction and results at a fraction of the cost, and I couldn't be more grateful for the exceptional results we've seen. Now, our child is not only an avid learner, but she is also at the top of her class!"</p>

                <p>"I didn't really care about school at first. My grades were in the gutter and my future wasn't looking too bright.
                    I took a leap of faith and tried this tutoring program, and I'm glad I did. After just one semester in this program,
                    my grades have turned around. I now have a passion for learning that wasn't there before, and I'm on track to graduate with honors!"</p>

<p>"I used to hate math because I wasn't good at it, and my parents weren't able to help because they were always working. But then my mom signed me up for this 
    tutoring program. The tutors there are nice and understand us as students since most of them are students themselves. 
    The center also gives us meals and school supplies, and most importantly, I get the help I need for things I don't understand,
    and it translates to me doing better in school. Now, after just one year, math is my strongest subject! "</p>
